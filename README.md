# Data Science Assignment

## Overview
This project is based on a data science take-home project focused on load forecasting using temperature data. The assignment involves the use of time series forecasting techniques to analyze kWh (kilowatt-hour) data and temperature data in order to predict the peak-load each day.

## Data
The dataset includes kWh load data and temperature data at hourly intervals. The temperature data is used as an input for the forecasting model.

## Implementation
The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook. Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Brief Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Implementation of the naive and CatBoost predictive model.
- Model evaluation and validation.
- Generation of predictions for the year 2008 based on historical data.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including model accuracy and insights, are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook, and output predictions.

## Running the Code
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Open `Bultema_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- CatBoost
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)
